Child  Day Care Management
Hiii everyone, 
baby day care management system is a web-based application that helps 
parents enroll their children in daycare without waiting in line. It can also 
store and update user data, such as daily activities. A child care management 
system (CCMS) helps daycare and childcare centers manage their daily 
operations and provide child care assistance. These systems can help with 
tasks such as: Lesson planning, Invoice tracking, Attendance and meal 
program tracking, Parent-teacher collaboration, and Progress reports. 
The main objective for developing this web-based application is to provide an 
easier way to enroll child in a day care. It will use a database and webserver 
backend and will present an easy-to-use interface for children to be checked 
in and their information to be managed. In “Baby Day Care Management” we 
use PHP and MySQL database. This project has two modules i.e. admin and 
use.
